		        <h1>We are</h1>
		        <p>a small team of college students who have a goal; to make a single anime episode. By small, I mean a core team of 3 people, with other people being brought in for particular one-off tasks. Our budget is also small, maxing out at $300.</p>
		        <p>Despite this, I have confidence that our goal is acheivable. We will be trying to accomplish a task that professional studios hire huge teams of people for, but it's important to remember that we don't need to do so nearly as quickly. A professional studio will churn out an episode every week; we are aiming to do the same task in a year.</p>
		        <p>This blog will serve two purposes: the first will be for me to document our journey down this path; the second will be to give advice and recommendations for anyone who may want to try something similar.</p>
		        <p>I hope you enjoy.</p>
